## Abstract
This research proposes the Tangram Protocol, a framework designed to address critical gaps in secure medical data analysis. While many decentralized solutions for healthcare exist, this work pioneers a specific, underexplored methodology centered on the tight integration of three key pillars: **hybrid storage-ledger architecture, advanced cryptography (specifically Zero-Knowledge Proofs), and formal verification**. This unique combination creates a secure, privacy-preserving platform where medical data can be analyzed without ever being exposed, addressing a fundamental limitation in existing systems.

Key innovations include a decentralized identity management system, fine-grained access control mechanisms, and privacy-preserving computation capabilities. The protocol's architecture ensures data integrity through cryptographic proofs while maintaining patient confidentiality through advanced ZKP techniques. By eliminating centralized points of failure and enabling verifiable computation on encrypted data, Tangram addresses critical gaps in current healthcare data systems.

This research will validate the protocol's effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and practical implementation, with performance benchmarks against existing solutions. The expected contributions include novel cryptographic constructions for medical data privacy, a reference implementation, and empirical evidence of the system's scalability and security properties. The outcomes aim to establish new standards for ethical and efficient healthcare data utilization in research and clinical practice.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

This study undertakes a comprehensive systematic review of existing medical data sharing methodologies, with particular emphasis on multi-institutional clinical trial data management practices. The review critically examines current frameworks, technologies, and policies governing medical data access and analysis. It uncovers inherent limitations in privacy preservation, interoperability challenges, and computational inefficiencies. Through this analytical process, the study identifies unresolved issues and research gaps in the literature regarding secure collaborative analysis of longitudinal patient health records. This establishes a clear rationale and justification for developing the Tangram Protocol as a novel solution [20][21].

Current medical data systems suffer from fundamental architectural flaws that impede secure collaboration. Traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) create isolated data silos vulnerable to cyberattacks. Existing decentralized approaches fail to provide true end-to-end privacy guarantees during analysis phases. Medical data typically remains protected only in transit and at rest, but must be decrypted for analysis. This creates critical vulnerability points that compromise patient privacy.

This study develops and validates the Tangram Protocol as a transformative solution that distinguishes itself through a novel synthesis of technologies. Its core innovation lies in a **hybrid architecture** combining a distributed ledger for immutable audit trails with decentralized storage for scalable data management. This structure is secured through **advanced cryptography**, using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) not only for access control but for private computation on encrypted data. Finally, the protocol's integrity is mathematically guaranteed through **formal verification**. This tripartite approach directly addresses the critical vulnerability where data privacy is compromised during computational analysisâ€”a gap left open by most existing frameworks.

## 2. Research Objectives

1. **Design a Decentralized Protocol:** Architect a novel, platform-agnostic protocol for secure medical record management that integrates a hybrid storage-ledger model.
2. **Implement Privacy-Preserving Computation:** Implement and validate advanced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) circuits to enable privacy-preserving analysis of medical data.
3. **Achieve Native FHIR Interoperability:** Design the protocol's data models and APIs to be natively compliant with **HL7/FHIR** standards, enabling seamless, out-of-the-box integration with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and health information exchanges.
4. **Develop Patient-Centric Access Control:** Create a robust, patient-centric access control mechanism using decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.
5. **Evaluate Performance and Security:** Rigorously evaluate the protocol's performance, scalability, and security through formal verification and empirical benchmarking against existing solutions.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation

### 3.1 Medical Data Sharing and Analysis Challenges

This study will conduct a systematic examination of medical data sharing challenges across regulatory, technical, and operational dimensions. The investigation will analyze how privacy, security, and interoperability constraints under frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR create barriers to collaborative medical research [4]. Through comprehensive analysis of existing solutions, including blockchain-based frameworks for clinical data sharing [3], the research will identify critical gaps where current approaches fail to enable secure multi-institutional analysis of medical data without compromising patient privacy, thereby establishing the necessity for novel cryptographic approaches that maintain data confidentiality during computation [6][7][9][16][21].

### 3.2 Distributed Ledger Technologies in Medical Data Management

This research will comprehensively evaluate the application of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) in medical data management, examining early deployments such as MedRec for medical data access and permission management [10] and Hedera's healthcare applications [8][11], to understand scalability and privacy limitations [1][2]. The study will analyze how modern DLTs with expressive smart contract capabilities can serve as foundations for managing medical data as programmable on-chain entities with embedded access policies. This analysis will demonstrate how DLTs can provide immutable audit trails and access control for medical data while integrating with decentralized storage systems for scalable data management, thereby justifying the selection of DLT-based architecture for the Tangram Protocol.

### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Medical Data Privacy

This investigation will conduct an in-depth analysis of ZKP applications in healthcare, examining how cryptographic techniques like zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs can enable verifiable computation on encrypted medical data [13]. The study will systematically review existing implementations to identify limitations in current approaches and demonstrate how ZKP circuits can execute complex statistical analyses and cohort selections on medical data without revealing underlying patient information. This analysis will establish how ZKP technology can transform medical data analysis by enabling researchers to obtain proven, correct results without accessing raw patient data, thereby providing the theoretical foundation for implementing privacy-preserving computation in the Tangram Protocol.

### 3.4 Decentralized Storage for Medical Data

This research will evaluate decentralized storage systems, including IPFS for content-addressed file systems [15], for their suitability in managing large-scale medical datasets, examining attributes such as censorship resistance, availability guarantees, and cryptographic integrity proofs. The study will analyze how decentralized storage can serve as a secure, off-chain repository for encrypted longitudinal patient health records while maintaining integration with on-chain access control mechanisms, thereby establishing the technical foundation for hybrid on-chain/off-chain medical data management in the Tangram Protocol.

### 3.5 Healthcare Interoperability Standards

This section will conduct a detailed analysis of foundational healthcare interoperability standards, focusing on **Health Level Seven (HL7)** and its modern successor, **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)**. The research will trace the evolution from legacy HL7 versions (V2, V3, CDA) to the modern, API-centric approach of FHIR. The analysis will cover:

- **FHIR's Core Principles:** A review of FHIR's design philosophy, including its focus on discrete, computable data elements known as **Resources** (e.g., `Patient`, `Observation`, `Encounter`), its use of modern web standards like RESTful APIs and JSON/XML, and its extensibility through **Profiles** and **Extensions**.
- **Syntactic and Semantic Interoperability:** An examination of how FHIR provides a common data model and terminology bindings (e.g., to SNOMED CT, LOINC) to ensure that exchanged data is both structurally sound and clinically meaningful.
- **Integration Strategy for Tangram:** This study will investigate how Tangram can natively align with FHIR by modeling on-chain digital assets and off-chain data pointers as FHIR Resources. The protocol will expose a FHIR-compliant API layer, enabling existing EHR systems and healthcare applications to interact with Tangram using familiar, standardized protocols. This approach ensures that Tangram is not another data silo but a seamless extension of the existing digital health ecosystem, justifying its design as a practical and adoptable solution for clinical environments.

### 3.6 Global and Regional Regulatory Landscape

A comprehensive review of the global and regional regulatory landscape will be conducted to establish a robust compliance foundation for the Tangram Protocol. This analysis will focus on:

- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** An in-depth examination of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. The study will analyze the definitions of Protected Health Information (PHI) and the obligations of Covered Entities and Business Associates. We will investigate how Tangram's architectureâ€”with its immutable audit trails and ZKP-based privacy controlsâ€”can help entities meet HIPAA's stringent requirements for access control, auditability, and data integrity.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** A detailed analysis of GDPR's core principles, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, and purpose limitation. The research will focus on the rights of data subjects (e.g., right to access, right to erasure) and the requirements for data protection by design and by default. We will explore how Tangram's patient-centric model and cryptographic guarantees can support GDPR compliance, particularly in cross-border data sharing scenarios.
- **Other Regional Regulations:** The study will also consider other significant data protection frameworks, such as **Vietnam's Decree 13/2023/ND-CP on Personal Data Protection**. This comparative analysis will identify common principles and divergent requirements, informing the design of a flexible, policy-driven compliance module within Tangram that can be adapted to various jurisdictional demands.

- **Mitigation:** Explore recursive ZKP compositions and off-chain computation to reduce on-chain overhead.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions. The protocol must navigate the complex and sometimes conflicting requirements of regulations like **HIPAA**, which governs protected health information (PHI) in the U.S., and **GDPR**, which protects personal data in the EU.
- **Mitigation:** The protocol will be designed with a 'privacy-by-design' philosophy, incorporating data minimization and purpose limitation principles. We will develop a modular compliance framework that allows for configurable policies based on jurisdictional requirements. This includes implementing robust consent mechanisms and ensuring data subject rights (e.g., right to erasure) can be honored, even in a decentralized context. Consultation with legal experts specializing in health data protection will be ongoing.

### 5.7 Ethical Considerations

This research will adhere to the highest ethical standards. Although we will be using synthetic datasets, the protocol is designed to handle sensitive medical information. The design will prioritize patient privacy and data autonomy, ensuring that patients have full control over their data. The research will also consider the ethical implications of using decentralized systems in healthcare, including issues of accessibility and digital literacy.

### 5.8 Alignment with Research Objectives
